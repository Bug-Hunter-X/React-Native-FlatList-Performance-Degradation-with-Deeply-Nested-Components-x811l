This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and attempting to render items that contain deeply nested components or complex data structures.  The root cause is often a component re-rendering that leads to excessive work for the `FlatList` resulting in dropped frames and performance issues.

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{nested: {data: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30]}}]}
  renderItem={({item}) => (
    <View>
      {item.nested.data.map(i => (
        <Text key={i}>{i}</Text>
      ))}
    </View>
  )}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => index}
/>
```
